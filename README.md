The Road Traffic Video Monitoring using YOLO project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to monitor and analyze traffic flow in real-time. By applying YOLO to video footage, the system can detect, track, and classify vehicles, enabling insights into traffic patterns, congestion levels, and potential incidents. This project showcases the application of deep learning techniques in traffic management and urban planning, providing a foundation for smart city infrastructure and automated traffic control systems.
